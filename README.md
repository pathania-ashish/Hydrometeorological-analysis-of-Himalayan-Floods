July floods in Himachal
 In recent decades, the Himalayas have seen increasing extreme precipitation events. Climate change has impacted the occurrence and distribution of extreme precipitation events across the Himalayas. On July 07â€“11, 2023, several districts of Himachal Pradesh faced devastating floods resulting in loss of life, infrastructure, and environmental damage with significant economic consequences. The study reveals that compounding of extremely heavy rainfall with near-saturation antecedent moisture content and snowmelt was found to be the leading factor in inflating and sustaining the flood peak.
